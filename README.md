🧹 Smart Vacuum and Mop Cleaner
This project was created during my first year of college in the winter holidays, to represent my Department for the G20 Summit exhibition. It is a DIY prototype of an obstacle-avoiding robot that functions as both a vacuum and a mop cleaner — designed entirely from recycled materials.

🛠️ Built With Scrap Materials
The body of the cleaner is made using household and recycled items:

--> 2L Soft Drink Bottle

--> Piece of Plywood

--> Plastic Jar Cap & Jar

--> IV Infusion Set (used for controlled water supply in mopping)

🚀 Functionality
This project is a modified version of a typical obstacle-avoiding robot, enhanced to perform dual cleaning actions:

🧼 Vacuum Cleaning

🧽 Mopping

🛑 Obstacle Detection & Avoidance

Both vacuum and mop functions can operate independently or simultaneously, making it versatile for basic smart cleaning.
